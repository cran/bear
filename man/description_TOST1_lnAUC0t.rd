\title{Description for Two One-Sided Test for lnAUC0t}

\description{
Interpretation:
Ho: MEAN-test/MEAN-ref =< ln(lower acceptance) or  MEAN-test/MEAN-ref >= ln(Upper acceptance)
Ha: ln(lower acceptance) < MEAN-test/MEAN-ref < ln(Upper acceptance)
 Because all P values are less than 0.05, we will reject the null hypothesis (Ho).
